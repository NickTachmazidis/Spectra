# Requirements

matplotlib == 3.3.2<br/>
mplcursors == 0.4<br/>
numpy == 1.19.2<br/>
pandas == 1.1.3<br/>

# Spectra's history
My current PhD studies focus in non-destructive methods and empasize in analysing artworks and drawing inferences from the collected data. As a technology and automation enthusiast I became an autodidactic Python learner and developed a graphic user interface (GUI) with built-in functions for automating the proccess of pigment, ink and substrate identification. My goal is to help fellow researchers and conservation scientists for certified material authentication.

# Updates
Spectra application will be continuously updated and optimized. Any suggestion is welcomed.

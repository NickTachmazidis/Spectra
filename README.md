# Spectra's history

My current PhD studies focus in non-destructive methods and empasize in analysing artworks and drawing inferences from the collected data. As a technology and automation enthusiast I became an autodidactic Python learner and developed a graphic user interface (GUI) with built-in functions and scripts for automating the proccess of pigment, ink and substrate identification. My goal is to build a database that can be used from future conservators, museums and conservation science laboratories for certified material authentication.

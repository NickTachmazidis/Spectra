# Spectra's history
My current PhD studies focus in non-destructive methods and emphasize in analysing artworks and drawing inferences from the collected data. As a technology and automation enthusiast I became an autodidactic Python learner and developed a graphic user interface (GUI) with built-in functions for automating the proccess of pigment, ink and substrate identification. My goal is to help fellow researchers and conservation scientists for certified material authentication.

# Updates
Spectra application will be continuously updated and optimized. Any feedback and suggestion for improving Spectra is welcomed.

# Usage
I invite you to use and adapt this program as you see fit. Itâ€™s completely public and available under the MIT license. All that I ask is that you credit me.
